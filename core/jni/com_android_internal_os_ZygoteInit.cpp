// Shadow call stack (SCS) is a security mitigation that uses a separate stack
// (the SCS) for return addresses. In versions of Android newer than P, the
// compiler cooperates with the system to ensure that the SCS address is always
// stored in register x18, as long as the app was compiled with a new enough
// compiler and does not use features that rely on SP-HALs (this restriction is
// because the SP-HALs might not preserve x18 due to potentially having been
// compiled with an old compiler as a consequence of Treble; it generally means
// that the app must be a system app without a UI). This struct is used to
// temporarily store the address on the stack while preloading the SP-HALs, so
// that such apps can use the same zygote as everything else.
